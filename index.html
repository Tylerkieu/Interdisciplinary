          <p>
            Borders provide people with a sense of security as the border's gives physical protection and they are associated with the law so they are governed. Borders act as a physical boundary that helps prevent unauthorized access from the neighboring countries. This may make people feel safer by reducing the risk of outside threats. As the border is heavily guarded in most places with border patrol and border agents that control who enters the country. This can make people feel more secure because they know there are rules on who can enter the country, not allowing bad people to enter.

          <h2>Stability and Order</h2>
          <p>
            Borders help to bring stability by demarcating where a government of a country has authority. This avoids border conflicts and makes it easier for the government to enforce laws, provide services, and maintain order. With defined borders, countries can control resources and determine who comes in or goes out. Borders also help countries to peacefully cooperate through diplomacy, and concerns like trade, security, and migration become more manageable.
